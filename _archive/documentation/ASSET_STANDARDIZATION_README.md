## üìã Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Database Migration

Run the database migration to create the required tables:

```bash
# Navigate to your ConstructLink directory
cd /path/to/ConstructLink

# Run the migration (if you have a migration system)
php run_migration.php add_asset_standardization_system

# OR import directly to MySQL
mysql -u username -p database_name < database/migrations/add_asset_standardization_system.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation

Run the test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
# Access via browser
http://yoursite.com/constructlink/test_asset_standardization.php

# OR run via command line
php test_asset_standardization.php
```

### Step 3: File Permissions

Ensure proper permissions for shared hosting:

```bash
chmod 644 core/AssetStandardizer.php
chmod 644 assets/js/asset-standardizer.js
chmod -R 644 api/assets/
chmod 644 views/assets/create.php
chmod 644 views/admin/asset-standardization.php
```

### Step 4: Initial Configuration

1. **Access Admin Panel**: Navigate to `?route=admin/asset-standardization`
2. **Review Sample Data**: Check that disciplines, asset types, and brands are loaded
3. **Test Asset Creation**: Go to `?route=assets/create` and test the enhanced form
4. **Configure Permissions**: Ensure user roles have appropriate access

## üîß Configuration Options

### Session-Based Caching (Shared Hosting Optimized)

The system uses PHP sessions for caching to work efficiently on shared hosting:

```php
// In core/AssetStandardizer.php
private $cacheExpiry = 3600; // 1 hour cache (adjust as needed)
```

### API Rate Limits

Configure debounce timers for API calls:

```javascript
// In assets/js/asset-standardizer.js
this.debounceTimers.name = setTimeout(() => {
    // Validation logic
}, 300); // 300ms delay (adjust as needed)
```

### Search Performance

For large asset databases, adjust search limits:

```php
// In api/assets/enhanced-search.php
$perPage = min(50, max(10, (int)($_GET['per_page'] ?? 20)));
```

## üìä Usage Examples

### Creating a New Asset

1. Navigate to **Assets > Create New Asset**
2. Type asset name: "hamer drill" 
   - System suggests: "Hammer Drill"
   - Shows correction alert with acceptance option
3. Select category: System auto-suggests applicable disciplines
4. Enter brand: "dewalt" ‚Üí Auto-corrected to "DeWalt"
5. System displays relevant specifications based on asset type
6. Submit with confidence that data is standardized

### Admin Management

1. Access **Admin > Asset Standardization**
2. **Spelling Corrections Tab**: 
   - Review user-submitted corrections
   - Approve/reject corrections
   - Add manual corrections
3. **Brand Management Tab**:
   - Verify brand names
   - Add variations
   - Set quality tiers
4. **Analytics Tab**:
   - Monitor search success rates
   - Review most common misspellings
   - Track system learning progress

### Enhanced Search

1. Use the enhanced search API:
```javascript
fetch('/api/assets/enhanced-search.php?q=drill&disciplines=civil,mech')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        // data.meta.corrections_applied shows any spelling fixes
        // data.facets provides dynamic filter options
        // data.suggestions offers alternative search terms
    });
```

## üé® User Interface Features

### Smart Input Fields

- **Real-time validation** with visual feedback icons
- **Color-coded confidence levels**:
  - üü¢ Green: High confidence (>90%)
  - üü° Yellow: Medium confidence (70-90%)
  - üîµ Blue: Low confidence (50-70%)
  - ‚ö´ Gray: Unknown/new entry

### Progressive Enhancement

- Works without JavaScript (graceful degradation)
- Enhanced experience with JavaScript enabled
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet use
- Touch-friendly controls for warehouse staff

### Multi-Language Support

The system is designed to support regional variations:

```sql
-- Example: Regional spelling variations
INSERT INTO asset_spelling_corrections (incorrect, correct, context) VALUES
('aluminium', 'aluminum', 'material'),  -- UK vs US spelling
('spanner', 'wrench', 'tool_name'),     -- Regional tool names
('tyre', 'tire', 'material');           -- Regional material names
```

## üîç Advanced Features

### Phonetic Matching

For users who spell phonetically:

```php
$soundex = soundex($query);
$metaphone = metaphone($query);
// System matches based on sound similarity
```

### Learning Algorithm

The system continuously improves through:

1. **User Corrections**: Direct feedback from users
2. **Selection Patterns**: Which suggestions users choose
3. **Search Success**: Tracking successful vs failed searches
4. **Administrative Approval**: Quality control for corrections

### API Integration

External systems can integrate via REST APIs:

```bash
# Validate asset name
GET /api/assets/validate-name.php?name=drill&category=power_tools

# Get suggestions
GET /api/assets/suggestions.php?q=ham&type=asset&limit=10

# Enhanced search
GET /api/assets/enhanced-search.php?q=welding&disciplines=mech,civil
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Spelling corrections not working**
```bash
# Check if corrections table has data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM asset_spelling_corrections WHERE approved = 1;

# Clear cache and reload
# Delete session cache or restart session
```

**2. JavaScript not loading**
```html
<!-- Verify script is included -->
<script src="/assets/js/asset-standardizer.js"></script>

<!-- Check browser console for errors -->
<!-- Verify file permissions (644) -->
```

**3. Database connection errors**
```php
// Check database configuration
// Verify migration was run successfully
// Check MySQL error logs
```

**4. API endpoints returning 403/404**
```bash
# Verify file exists and permissions
ls -la api/assets/validate-name.php

# Check .htaccess for rewrites
# Verify authentication is working
```

### Performance Optimization

**For High-Volume Usage:**

1. **Enable MySQL Query Cache**:
```sql
SET GLOBAL query_cache_size = 1048576;
SET GLOBAL query_cache_type = ON;
```

2. **Add Database Indexes**:
```sql
-- Additional indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_assets_name_fulltext ON assets (name);
CREATE INDEX idx_search_history_query ON asset_search_history (search_query, search_timestamp);
```

3. **Implement Redis Caching** (if available):
```php
// Replace session cache with Redis
$redis = new Redis();
$redis->connect('127.0.0.1', 6379);
$redis->setex('asset_corrections', 3600, $correctionData);
```

## üìà Analytics and Reporting

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Spelling Correction Accuracy**: How often corrections are accepted
2. **Search Success Rate**: Percentage of searches returning results
3. **User Adoption**: How many users are using the new features
4. **Data Quality Improvement**: Reduction in inconsistent asset names

    public function customValidation($data) {
        // Your custom logic here
    }
}
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Activating the System

Simply provide a task to any Claude Code instance in the ConstructLink project:

```
"Review the borrowed tools module"
"Fix security vulnerabilities"
"Refactor hardcoded permissions"
"Optimize database queries"
```

The Master Orchestrator will:
1. Scan the context
2. Identify necessary agents
3. Execute cascade sequence
4. Learn from results
5. Provide comprehensive report

### Manual Agent Invocation

You can also directly invoke specific agents:

```
"Invoke the Security Agent to scan for vulnerabilities"
"Have the Database Refactor Agent analyze the schema"
"Run the Testing Agent on recent changes"
```

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration

### Trigger Thresholds

Agents have configurable trigger thresholds:

```yaml
code_review_agent:
  auto_trigger: true
  priority: 1
  pattern: "*.php|*.js|*.sql"

security_agent:
  immediate: true
  override_priority: true
  pattern: "SQL injection|XSS|vulnerability"
```

### Parallel Execution

Certain agents can run in parallel:

```yaml
parallel_safe:
  - [ui_ux_agent, performance_agent]
  - [testing_agent, documentation_agent]
```

### Dependencies

Some agents depend on others completing first:

```yaml

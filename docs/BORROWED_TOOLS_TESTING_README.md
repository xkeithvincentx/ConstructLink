# Borrowed Tools User Testing - Guide for Test Administrators

## Overview

This testing suite is designed to extract genuine user feedback about the Borrowed Tools module through blind testing methodology. The goal is to identify usability issues, confusing workflows, missing features, and areas for improvement.

---

## Testing Package Contents

1. **BORROWED_TOOLS_USER_TESTING.md** - The main testing document for users to complete
2. **BORROWED_TOOLS_TESTING_ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE.md** - Template for consolidating results from multiple testers
3. **BORROWED_TOOLS_TESTING_README.md** - This guide

---

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
- Identify confusing or difficult workflows
- Discover missing features users expect
- Find bugs and system errors
- Validate that core functionality works as intended
- Gather satisfaction metrics

### Success Criteria
- At least 5 different users complete the testing
- Representation from all key user roles (Warehouseman, Project Manager, Site Inventory Clerk)
- 80%+ scenario completion rate
- Clear prioritization of issues for development team

---

## Test Administration Process

### Phase 1: Preparation (Before Testing)

1. **Print or Provide Digital Copies**
   - Print `BORROWED_TOOLS_USER_TESTING.md` for each tester
   - OR provide editable digital copies (Word/PDF)
   - Ensure testers have a pen or can type responses

2. **Prepare Test Environment**
   - Ensure system is running and accessible
   - Create test data if needed (sample tools, projects, users)
   - Verify all roles have appropriate permissions
   - Note system version and any known issues

3. **Select Test Participants**
   - **Ideal Mix**:
     - 2 Warehousemen (primary users)
     - 2 Project Managers (borrowers)
     - 1 Site Inventory Clerk
     - 1-2 occasional users (for fresh perspective)
   - Avoid selecting only power users - include normal and novice users

4. **Schedule Test Sessions**
   - Allow 45-60 minutes per tester
   - Schedule in a quiet environment with minimal interruptions
   - Stagger sessions to avoid server overload

---

### Phase 2: Conducting Tests

#### Before Starting Each Session

1. **Brief the Tester (5 minutes)**
   - Explain the purpose: "We want to improve the system based on your real experience"
   - Emphasize honesty: "There are no wrong answers. If you get confused, that's valuable feedback"
   - Clarify this is a **blind test**: "Try to complete tasks without asking for help first"
   - Mention time commitment: "This should take 45-60 minutes"

2. **Provide Login Credentials**
   - Give them credentials matching their typical role
   - Ensure they can access the borrowed tools module

3. **Set Expectations**
   - "You may encounter bugs - that's okay, just note them"
   - "If you can't complete a scenario, move to the next one"
   - "Think out loud if possible - it helps us understand your thought process"

#### During Testing

**DO:**
- Observe silently (note-taking is okay)
- Watch for signs of confusion (long pauses, frustrated expressions)
- Note how long each scenario takes
- Record any verbal comments they make

**DON'T:**
- Provide hints or guidance unless they're completely stuck (and mark it if you do)
- Interrupt their workflow
- Defend or explain the system
- Rush them through scenarios

#### After Testing

1. **Quick Debrief (5-10 minutes)**
   - "Was there anything particularly confusing?"
   - "What did you like about the system?"
   - "If you could change one thing, what would it be?"

2. **Collect the Document**
   - Ensure all sections are complete
   - Label with Tester ID (T001, T002, etc.) for anonymity
   - Thank them for their time

---

### Phase 3: Analysis (After All Tests)

1. **Consolidate Results**
   - Use `BORROWED_TOOLS_TESTING_ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE.md`
   - Go through each scenario and tally results
   - Look for patterns (3+ testers reporting same issue = pattern)

2. **Categorize Issues**
   - **Critical**: System breaking, data loss, security issues
   - **High Priority**: Major usability problems affecting many users
   - **Medium Priority**: Moderate issues with workarounds
   - **Low Priority**: Minor improvements, cosmetic issues

3. **Identify Quick Wins**
   - Issues that are high-impact but easy to fix
   - Common requests that can be implemented quickly

4. **Create Action Plan**
   - Prioritize top 5 critical issues
   - Assign owners and deadlines
   - Estimate effort for each fix

## Tips for Effective Testing

### Getting Honest Feedback
- Reassure testers their feedback won't reflect poorly on them
- Avoid defensive reactions to criticism
- Create a safe environment for honest opinions

### Handling Stuck Testers
- If stuck for 3+ minutes, ask: "What are you looking for?"
- Provide minimal guidance to unstick them
- Note that guidance was needed in your observations

### Encouraging Detailed Comments
- Ask follow-up questions during debrief
- Probe on vague comments: "Can you give me an example?"
- Ask "why" to understand root causes

## Common Testing Pitfalls to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Testing Only with Power Users
**Problem**: Power users are familiar with workarounds and don't represent typical users.
**Solution**: Include novice and intermediate users.

### Pitfall 2: Providing Too Much Help
**Problem**: If you guide users, you won't discover usability issues.
**Solution**: Let them struggle (within reason). Note where they struggled.

### Pitfall 3: Small Sample Size
**Problem**: 1-2 testers aren't enough to identify patterns.
**Solution**: Aim for 5-7 testers minimum.

### Pitfall 4: Ignoring Failed Scenarios
**Problem**: Skipping failed scenarios means missing critical issues.
**Solution**: Encourage testers to attempt all scenarios, even if previous ones failed.

### Pitfall 5: Not Acting on Feedback
**Problem**: Testing without follow-up wastes everyone's time.
**Solution**: Create action items and communicate fixes back to testers.
